## Overview
InsightCore is an open-source ASP.NET Core MVC application designed for **W3C log analysis, anomaly detection, and real-time monitoring**. Built on **.NET 8**, it leverages **ML.NET** for detecting anomalies in logs and health metrics, providing valuable insights into server performance, security, and operational health.

With an intuitive web-based UI, InsightCore allows developers and administrators to **query, filter, and visualize** IIS logs effortlessly. It features a **built-in query language** for flexible log searching and analysis, inspired by industry-standard log query syntaxes.

## Key Features
- **W3C Log Parsing:** Automatically parses IIS logs into a structured format for analysis.
- **ML-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Uses **ML.NET** to identify unusual patterns in logs and health metrics.
- **Custom Query Language:** Execute powerful queries to analyze logs efficiently.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Detect and visualize server health status, request patterns, and anomalies.
- **Fast Filtering & Sorting:** Query logs instantly with commands like:
  ```
  index=iis ping | order desc | take 10
  ```
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Gain insights from **visualized metrics, error trends, and server health indicators**.
- **Extensible & Open Source:** Designed to be customized and integrated into any .NET environment.

## Query Language
InsightCore includes a query language for log analysis. Some examples:
- **Isolate to specific Uris**
  ```
  index=iis cs-uri-stem=/app/v1/ping
  ```
- **Get the last 10 requests using pipe keywords**
  ```
  index=iis cs-uri-stem=/app/v1/ping | order desc | take 10
  ```
- **Loose definition detection**
  ```
  index=iis /app/v1/ping myusername 
  ```
- **Strict definition detection**
  ```
  index=iis cs-uri-stem=/app/v1/ping cs-username=myusername 
  ```
- **Conditional Statements**
  ```
  index=iis cs-uri-stem=/app/v1/ping NOT cs-username=myusername  NOT testing
  ```

## Keywords & Wildcards
- **Keywords:** Keywords are part of result post-processing, giving the user the ability to take a certain number of records or re-order the results by ascending/descending order. **Note:** Order matters.
  - `| take <num> |` - Takes a specified number of results.
  - `| order <asc/desc> |` - Orders results based on log timestamp.
- **Wildcards:** When using strictly defined fields and values, you can insert the `*` character to locate a pattern or value.
  - Example:
    ```
    index=iis /app/login username=hello*rld
    ```
  - The wildcard character `*` can be used at the start, end, or both to match patterns flexibly.
    ```
    index=iis LookupUser=steven*  
    index=iis LookupUser=*-test1  
    ```
